# Robodeck Front gap sensor

## Description
This small board features two TCRT5000 sensors and a votlage controlled current source to control the brightness of the IR LEDs in the sensors if needed/wanted.

## Hardware connections 
Connections marked on the board.

In constant current mode: 
- Solder a resistor on R1 and R3 to set the current 
- Solder JP1 and JP2 to GND

In controlled current mode: 
- Connect CLIFF_CTRL signal to an analog voltage source (ex: STM32 DAC)
- Solder a 0 ohm resistor to R1 and R3
- Solder JP1 and JP2 to CTRL

>Note: the current source feeds both analog sensors together, not individually.
